I generated a conda environment called Twitter_API using python 3.9.12, into which I installed tweepy, requests (2.24.0) and requests-oathlib (1.3.0).  
This is the envonment where I will write all of my python scripts for test cases.
I also exported my authorization credentials into this environment.
