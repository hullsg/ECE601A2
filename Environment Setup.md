To gain access to the Twitter API, I setup a Twitter account and subsequently a Twitter Dveloper account.  This is where I established an App/Project and got my authorization credentials.

I then setup a Rapid API account so that I could subscribe to Botometer.


I generated a conda environment called Twitter_API using python 3.9.12, into which I installed tweepy, requests (2.24.0) and requests-oathlib (1.3.0).  
This is the envonment where I will write all of my python scripts for test cases.
I also exported my authorization credentials into this environment.
