APP User Stories

As a fan of live music, I want to know what people have thought about concerts from particular artists so I know which ones to buy tickets for when the artist is playing in my area.
I want to be able to search tweets about a certain artist that I am interested and get back information about whether people liked or disliked a concert from that artist that they attended.

As a music venue owner, I want to see how popular a particular artist has been at their concerts so I can decide whether I should host them when the are touring in my city.
I want to be able to compare tweets about multiple artists that are about to go on tour so I can know which ones are more popular and decide which artists I will host at my venue.

APP MVP
My App should be able to retrieve tweets based on hashtags surrounding the artists and their performances (i.e. #"artist name", #"tour and tour year", #tickets, #live, etc).  The retrieved tweets should then be analyzed for their general sentiment (positive or negative sentiment) and the output should be the result of this sentiment.
