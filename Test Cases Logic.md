Each test case uses the bearer token for authentication.

The get_users_tweets test case takes a specified id for a target user and requests the 10 most recent tweets from that user since December 1st, 2022.  For each of these 10 tweets, the user id belonging to the tweet and the text of the tweet should be returned.

The get_user test case searches for a user based on the Twitter handle given and returns the user id.
